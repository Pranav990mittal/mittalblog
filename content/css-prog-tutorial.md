## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up the Environment

You only need a browser and a text editor (like VS Code). You can embed CSS:

- Inline: in the `style` attribute
- Internal: in `<style>` tags
- External: linked via `.css` file

</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, CSS!</h1>
</body>

h1 {
  color: blue;
  text-align: center;
}
