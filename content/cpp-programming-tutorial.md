# C++ Programming: A Comprehensive Guide

C++ is an extension of the C programming language that supports object-oriented and generic programming features. It‚Äôs used in systems programming, game engines, high-performance applications, and competitive programming.

## üß† What is C++?

C++ builds upon C by adding classes, templates, exception handling, and more. It‚Äôs both powerful and complex, providing low-level memory manipulation with high-level abstractions.

## üöÄ Why Learn C++?

- **Performance**: Offers fine-grained control over memory and hardware.
- **Versatility**: Used in systems software, desktop apps, games, and more.
- **STL (Standard Template Library)**: Rich library for containers and algorithms.
- **OOP & Procedural**: Supports multiple paradigms.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up the Environment

- Install a C++ compiler like `g++`:
  - Linux/macOS: `sudo apt install g++`
  - Windows: Use Code::Blocks or install MinGW
- Use a text editor or IDE like VS Code

Compile with:
```bash
g++ program.cpp -o program
./program
```

# CODE
```bash showLineNumbers
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ofstream file("example.txt");
    if (file.is_open()) {
        file << "This is a test file.\n";
        file.close();
        cout << "File written successfully." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Error opening file." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

```
